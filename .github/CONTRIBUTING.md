## 🐛 Reporting Issues

### Before Creating an Issue

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Check [Discussions](https://github.com/localstack-dotnet/dotnet-aspire-for-localstack/discussions)** - your question might already be answered
3. **Verify the issue** occurs with LocalStack integration in Aspire
4. **Test with latest version** when possible

### Creating a Bug Report

Use our [Issue Template](https://github.com/localstack-dotnet/dotnet-aspire-for-localstack/issues/new) which will guide you through providing:

- **Environment details** (LocalStack version, .NET Aspire version, .NET version, OS)
- **Minimal reproduction** case with Aspire AppHost
- **Expected vs actual** behavior
- **Configuration** and error messages

## 💡 Suggesting Features

We love new ideas! Here's how to suggest features:

1. **Check [existing discussions](https://github.com/localstack-dotnet/dotnet-aspire-for-localstack/discussions/categories/ideas)** for similar requests
2. **Start a [Discussion](https://github.com/localstack-dotnet/dotnet-aspire-for-localstack/discussions/new?category=ideas)** to gauge community interest
3. **Create an issue** if there's positive feedback and clear requirements

## 🔧 Contributing Code

### Before You Start

1. **Discuss significant changes** in [Discussions](https://github.com/localstack-dotnet/dotnet-aspire-for-localstack/discussions) first
2. **Check for existing work** - someone might already be working on it
3. **Create an issue** if one doesn't exist (for tracking)

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow existing code style and conventions
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Ensure all analyzers pass without warnings

3. **Test thoroughly**

   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   dotnet test
   ```

4. **Commit with conventional commits**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add support for XYZ service"
   git commit -m "fix: resolve timeout issue in DynamoDB client"
   git commit -m "docs: update installation guide"
   ```

5. **Submit the Pull Request**
   - Use our [PR Template](https://github.com/localstack-dotnet/dotnet-aspire-for-localstack/compare)
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Link related issues

### Code Quality Standards

- ✅ **Follow existing patterns** and architectural decisions
- ✅ **Write comprehensive tests** (unit, integration, functional where applicable)
- ✅ **Add XML documentation** for public APIs
- ✅ **No analyzer warnings** - we treat warnings as errors
- ✅ **Maintain backward compatibility** (unless it's a breaking change PR)
- ✅ **Performance considerations** - avoid introducing regressions

### Testing Guidelines

We have multiple test types:

- **Unit Tests** - Fast, isolated, no external dependencies
- **Integration Tests** - Test AWS Aspire integration

When adding tests:

- Place them in the appropriate test project
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Include tests for edge cases

## 📚 Documentation

- **Code comments** - Explain the "why", not the "what"
- **XML documentation** - Required for all public APIs
- **README updates** - For feature additions or breaking changes
- **CHANGELOG** - Add entries for user-facing changes

## 🔍 Review Process

1. **Automated checks** must pass (build, tests, code analysis)
2. **Maintainer review** - we aim to review within 48 hours
3. **Community feedback** - other contributors may provide input
4. **Iterative improvements** - address feedback promptly
5. **Final approval** and merge
